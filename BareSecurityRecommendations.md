# Bare Security Recommendations

1. Enable bare security
2. TODO: Work on a bare server and list it here, that would try to solve non-browser leeching. The possibility of this happening is low anyways, because HTTP servers are already cheap. Also, nobody would reasonably proxy a bare server, because it costs more bandwidth to do that than It would work by blocking suspicious IPs. When requests are exclusively being sent to `a set number of` origins, it will check to see, if it is making the requests that a modern browser would normally. If there are known JS runtimes or routers / web frameworks with exposed user-agents, those requests will automatically be blocked, but the IP won't be blocklisted.s
