## Standardize WT (WebTransports protocol) proxying

- [ ] Standardize
- [ ] Propose an alternative specification that will allow for WT over WS to support HTTP/1.1. This is because many reverse proxies that proxy sites use don't yet support HTTP/3, which is required to use WS. WS is most similar to WT.
