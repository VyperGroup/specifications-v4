# V4 proposal wants

I want to add

* Load indicators to the [bare meta](https://www.onion-router.net/): # of active connections and the ram usage. In the BareClient you will be able to sort an array, in which backends will be tried first given these load indicators in a function.
* Bare over WS
* Bare over WRTC
* EE2E using WASM-binded [Rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) and with ChaCha20-Poly1305 (thanks Blumiere)
* P2P (onion routing)[https://www.onion-router.net]. This will use WebRTC, with peer finding in the bare server where it finds peers that have that certain site unblocked with all of the resources unblocked tok. This feature will require versions to contain "p2p_routing", in the bare meta. This allows bare to be used exclusively for P2P (no proxying itself (other than the announcements) or combined. P2P onion routing will work under all protocols.
* [The BareClient](https://github.com/VyperGroup/bare-client-v4) will be standardized.

I want to change

* Rather than a language property in the bare meta, it would have a GitHub URL and commit hash
