# Bare WT

This should be preferred, if possible, but shouldn't be standardized, because WebTransports aren't widely supported nor used.

TODO: Complete standardization

## Fallback

If WT is unsupported, I recommend using a [ws-based polyfill](https://github.com/fails-components/webtransport-ponyfill-websocket)
